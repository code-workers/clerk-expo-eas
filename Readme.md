What works???: DEV MODE:
1) yarn start
2) Scan code with expo go
==>>> Clerk becomes ready

What does NOT WORK???:
1) npm install -g eas-cli
2) (maybe need to do eas login???)
3) yarn build
4) Run the resulting APK on an android device.

==>>>  Clerk will not becoome ready and stay loading
forever.
